# # Extract an arbitrary line from a 3D volume
#
# Arbitrary lines are often defined as piecewise lines on time/z slices or basemap views that draw a path through features of interest or for example between well locations.
#
# By extracting an arbitrary line we hope to end up with a uniformly sampled vertical section of data that traverses the path where the sampling interval is of the order of the bin interval of the dataset
