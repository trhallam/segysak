    "\n",
    "Headers in SEG-Y data are additional meta information associated with each trace. In SEG-Y these are not pooled in a common data block but interleaved with the seismic trace data so we need to do some work to extract it. **segysak** has two helper methods for extracting information from a SEG-Y file. These are `segy_header_scan` and `segy_header_scrape`. Both of these functions return `pandas.DataFrame` objects containing header or header related information which can be used in QC, analysis and plotting."
