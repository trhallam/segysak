## History

Segysak was originally conceived out of a need for a better interface to SEG-Y data
in Python. The groundwork was layed by Tony Hallam but development really began
during the Transform 2020 Software Underground Hackathon held online across
the world due to the cancellation of of the EAGE Annual in June of that year.
Significant contributions during the hackathon
were made by Steve Purves, Gijs Straathof, Fabio Contreras and Alessandro Amato del Monte.

Significant updates were made at Transform 2021. 
Multiple new and advanced examples were released.
A 2 hour video tutorial and notebook as a demonstration of key functionality
and an introduction to Xarry for seismic applications streamed. 
Experimental ZGY support was introduced.
