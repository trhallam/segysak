*SEGY-SAK* aims to be your Python Swiss Army Knife for Seismic Data.

To do this *SEGY-SAK* offers two things; a commandline interface (CLI) for
inspecting and converting SEGY data to a more friendly format called
NETCDF4, and by providing convienience functions for the data using
`xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_.
We try hard to load the data the same way everytime so your functions will
work no-matter which cube/line you load. The `xarray` conventions we use are
outlined in the documentation.

Why NETCDF4? Well, NETCDF4 is a fancy type of enclosed file binary format that
allows for faster indexing and data retreival than SEGY. We try our best to
scan in the header information and to make it easy (or easier) to load SEGY
in different formats, different configuration (2D, 2D gathers, 3D, 3D gathers).
We do all this with the help of `segyio <https://github.com/equinor/segyio>`_
which is a lower level interface to SEGY. If you stick to our ``xarray`` format
of files we also offer utility functions to return to SEGY so you can export to
other software.

Current Capabilities
-----------------------

- **CLI**:

  - Convert 2D, 3D and gathers type SEGY to NETCDF4 and back. The NETCDF4 files
    are one line open with ``xarray.open_dataset``.

  - Extract sub-volumes via cropping xline and inline.

  - Read EBCIDC header.

  - Perform a limited header scan.

* **Xarray and Python API**:

  * Load 2D, 3D and gathers type SEGY to a ``xarray.Dataset``.

  * Access header information and text headers in Python with conveience
    functions.

  * Select traces by UTM X and Y coordinates.

Installation
-------------

*SEGY-SAK* can be installed by using pip or python setuptools, we also provide an ``environment.yml`` for use
with conda.

Python Package Index via ``pip``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the command line run the ``pip`` package manager

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install segysak

Install from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clone the SEGY-SAK Github repository and in the top level directory run setuptools via

.. code-block:: shell

   python setup.py install


CLI Quick Start
-----------------

The command line interface (CLI) provides an easy tool to convert or
manipulate SEG-Y data. In your Python command-line environment it can be
accessed by calling `segysak`.

For a full list of options run

.. code-block:: shell

   segysak --help

Any SEG-Y files converted using the ``convert`` command. For example

.. code-block:: shell

   segysak convert test.segy

Can be loaded into *Python* using ``xarray``.

.. code-block:: python

   test = xarray.open_dataset('test.SEISNC')


``xarray`` seismic specification ``seisnc``
---------------------------------------------

The ``xarray`` seismic specification termed ``seisnc`` can be used by segysak to
output NETCDF4 files is more performant for Python operations than standard SEG-Y.
Unlike SEG-Y, ``xarray`` compatable files fit neatly into the Python scientific
stack providing operations like lazy loading, easy slicing, compatability with
multi-core and multi-node operations using ``dask`` as well as important features
such as labelled axes and coordinates.

This specification is not meant to be prescriptive but outlines some basic
requirements for ``xarray`` datasets to work with *SEGYSAK* functionality.

*SEGY-SAK* uses the convention ``.seisnc`` for the suffix on NETCDF4 files it
creates. These files are datasets with specific 1D and 2D coordiates and have a
single variable called ``data``.
The ``data`` variable contains the seismic cube volume or 2D line traces.
Attributes can be used to provide further metadata about the cube.

3D and 3D Gathers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*SEGY-SAK* uses the convention labels of ``iline``, ``xline`` and ``offset`` to
describe
the bins of 3D data. Vertical dimensions are ``twt`` and ``depth``. A typical
``xarray`` dataset created by *SEGY-SAK* will return for example

.. code-block:: python

   >>> seisnc_3d = segysak.segy_loader('test3d.sgy', iline=189, xline=193)
   >>> seisnc_3d.dims

   Frozen(SortedKeysDict({'iline': 61, 'xline': 202, 'twt': 850}))


2D and 2D Gathers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For 2D data SEGY-SAK uses the dimensino labels ``cdp`` and ``offset``. This allows
the package to distinguish between 2D and 3D data to allow automation on saving
and convience wrappers. The same vertical dimensions apply as for 3D.
A typical ``xarray`` in 2D format would return

.. code-block:: python

   >>> seisnc_2d = segysak.segy_loader('test2d.sgy', cdp=21)
   >>> seisnc_2d.dims

   Frozen(SortedKeysDict({'cdp': 61, 'twt': 850}))

Coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the ``cdpx`` and ``cdpy`` byte locations are specified during loading the
SEGY the coordinates will be populated from the headers with the variable names
``cdp_x`` and ``cdp_y``. These will have dimensions equivalent to the horizontal
dimensions of the data (``iline``, ``xline`` for 3D and ``cdp`` for 2D).

Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^
Any number of attributes can be added to a ``siesnc`` file. Currently the
following attributes are extracted or reserved for use by ``SEGY-SAK``.

 * ``ns`` number of samples per trace
 * ``ds`` sample interval
 * ``text`` ebcidc header as ascii text
 * ``d3_units`` vertical units of the data
 * ``d3_domain`` vertical domain of the data
 * ``epsg`` data epsg code
 * ``corner_points`` corner points of the dataset in grid coordinates
 * ``corner_points_xy`` corner points of the dataset in xy
 * ``source_file`` name of the file the dataset was created from
 * ``srd`` seismic reference datum of the data in vertical units ``d3_units``
   and ``d3_domain``
 * ``datatype`` the data type e.g. amplitude, velocity, attribute
