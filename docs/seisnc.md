SEISNC is set of conventions around loading data into Xarray datasets. The 
[standards](./seisnc-standard.md) assist some of the SEGY-SAK methods that 
support operations targetting seismic data but also ensure
the loaded seismic data is compatible with other exporters (e.g. NetCDF4, Zarr, ZGY).

The standards are not prescriptive, but SEGY-SAK functionality may not work properly
if they are not followed.
