SEISNC Standard for `xarray`
============================

The ``xarray`` seismic specification termed ``seisnc`` can be used by segysak to
output NETCDF4 files is more performant for Python operations than standard SEG-Y.
Unlike SEG-Y, ``xarray`` compatable files fit neatly into the Python scientific
stack providing operations like lazy loading, easy slicing, compatability with
multi-core and multi-node operations using ``dask`` as well as important features
such as labelled axes and coordinates.

This specification is not meant to be prescriptive but outlines some basic
requirements for ``xarray`` datasets to work with *SEGYSAK* functionality.

*SEGY-SAK* uses the convention ``.seisnc`` for the suffix on NETCDF4 files it
creates. These files are datasets with specific 1D and 2D coordiates and have a
single variable called ``data``.
The ``data`` variable contains the seismic cube volume or 2D line traces.
Attributes can be used to provide further metadata about the cube.

3D and 3D Gathers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*SEGY-SAK* uses the convention labels of ``iline``, ``xline`` and ``offset`` to
describe
the bins of 3D data. Vertical dimensions are ``twt`` and ``depth``. A typical
``xarray`` dataset created by *SEGY-SAK* will return for example

.. code-block:: python

   >>> seisnc_3d = segysak.segy_loader('test3d.sgy', iline=189, xline=193)
   >>> seisnc_3d.dims

   Frozen(SortedKeysDict({'iline': 61, 'xline': 202, 'twt': 850}))


2D and 2D Gathers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For 2D data SEGY-SAK uses the dimensino labels ``cdp`` and ``offset``. This allows
the package to distinguish between 2D and 3D data to allow automation on saving
and convience wrappers. The same vertical dimensions apply as for 3D.
A typical ``xarray`` in 2D format would return

.. code-block:: python

   >>> seisnc_2d = segysak.segy_loader('test2d.sgy', cdp=21)
   >>> seisnc_2d.dims

   Frozen(SortedKeysDict({'cdp': 61, 'twt': 850}))

Coordinates
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the ``cdpx`` and ``cdpy`` byte locations are specified during loading the
SEGY the coordinates will be populated from the headers with the variable names
``cdp_x`` and ``cdp_y``. These will have dimensions equivalent to the horizontal
dimensions of the data (``iline``, ``xline`` for 3D and ``cdp`` for 2D).

Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^
Any number of attributes can be added to a ``siesnc`` file. Currently the
following attributes are extracted or reserved for use by ``SEGY-SAK``.

 * ``ns`` number of samples per trace
 * ``ds`` sample interval
 * ``text`` ebcidc header as ascii text
 * ``measurement_sys`` vertical units of the data
 * ``d3_domain`` vertical domain of the data
 * ``epsg`` data epsg code
 * ``corner_points`` corner points of the dataset in grid coordinates
 * ``corner_points_xy`` corner points of the dataset in xy
 * ``source_file`` name of the file the dataset was created from
 * ``srd`` seismic reference datum of the data in vertical units ``measurement_sys``
   and ``d3_domain``
 * ``datatype`` the data type e.g. amplitude, velocity, attribute
 * ``percentiles`` this is an array of approximate percentile values created during
   scanning from SEGY. Primarily this is useful for plotting by limiting the dynamic
   range of the display. The percentiles are in percent 0, 0.1, 10, 50, 90, 99.9 & 100.
