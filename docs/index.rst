segysak: A library for loading and manipulating SEG-Y data with Python using **xarray**
========================================================================================

**SEGYSAK** can be use as a tool to handle *SEGY*
files inside Python environment.

By including  **SEGYSAK** in your toolbox you will be
able to load or transform the original binary *SEGY* data into more accessible and
Python friendly formats. It leverages the work of Segyio_ to simplify
loading of common SEGY formats into ``xarray.Dataset`` objects for east of use and
to NetCDF4_ files for better on disk and large file performance using dask_.
Tools to help users create new volumes and to return data to SEGY are also included.

Additional features include
----------------------------

 - **Arbitrary slicing and extration**

  - label based slicing
  - horizon
  - well path extraction

 - **Integrates with the existing Python scientific stack**

  - Leverage Xarray_ for easy coordinate management merging and plotting
  - Inheritted compatibility with core Python libraries (NumPy_, Scipy and Pandas_).
  - Works well with matplotlib_ and Pyvista_

 - **Scalability**

  - NetCDF4 files work with dask to scale your Python code to multi-core and
    distributed memory computing

History
-------
segysak was original conceived out of a need for a better interface to SEG-Y data
in Python. The ground work was layed by Tony Hallam but development really began
during the Transform 2020 Software Underground Hackathon held online across
the world due to the cancellation of of the EAGE Annual in June of that year.
Significant contributions during the hackathon
were made by Steve Purves, Gijs Straathof, Fabio Contreras and Alessandro Amato del Monte.
