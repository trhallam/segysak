SEGY-SAK: A library for loading and manipulating SEG-Y data with Python using **xarray**
========================================================================================

**SEGY-SAK** can be use as a tool to handle *SEG=Y*
files inside Python environment.

By including  **SEGY-SAK** in your toolbox you will be
able to load or transform the original binary *SEG-Y* data into more accessible and
Python friendly formats. It leverages the work of Segyio_ to simplify
loading of common SEG-Y formats into ``xarray.Dataset`` objects for ease of use and
to NetCDF4_ files for better on disk and large file performance using dask_.
Tools to help users create new volumes and to return data to SEG-Y are also included.

Additional features include
----------------------------

 - **Loading Assistance**
  - Loading of nDimensional SEG-Y data
  - Header editing
  - Loading of seismic data with missing traces

 - **Cube geometry functions**
  - Generate cube affine transform
  - Fill cdp_x and cdp_y

 - **Arbitrary slicing and extration**

  - Label based slicing
  - Arbitrary line slicing
  - Horizon extraction and sculpting
  - Well path extraction

 - **Integrates with the existing Python scientific stack**

  - Leverage Xarray_ for easy coordinate management merging and plotting
  - Inherited compatibility with core Python libraries (NumPy_, Scipy and Pandas_).
  - Works well with matplotlib_ and Pyvista_

 - Experimental baked in ZGY support via open-zgy_.
 - **Scalability**

  - NetCDF4 files work with dask to scale your Python code to multi-core and
    distributed memory computing

Many of the examples in this documentation use a subset of the the full Volve
dataset which was published by Equinor and you can read_ about it

History
-------
segysak was originally conceived out of a need for a better interface to SEG-Y data
in Python. The ground work was layed by Tony Hallam but development really began
during the Transform 2020 Software Underground Hackathon held online across
the world due to the cancellation of of the EAGE Annual in June of that year.
Significant contributions during the hackathon
were made by Steve Purves, Gijs Straathof, Fabio Contreras and Alessandro Amato del Monte.

Significant updates were made at Transform 2021. 
Multiple new and advanced examples were released.
A 2 hour video tutorial and notebook as a demonstration of key functionality
and an introduction to Xarry for seismic applications streamed. 
Experimental ZGY support was introduced.
