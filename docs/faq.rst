I have a HDF5 version conflict error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are in a conda environment this can occur when conflicts arrise from the
installed netCDF4 binaries and your system binaries. We suggest you try updating
the library with your distribution package manager. Re-creating your conda
environment or trying to reinstall the netCDF4 related packaged.
